## Microblaze Project

Softcores are an integral part of FPGA designs. It allows the engineer to have the best of both worlds. Applications can have both dedicated logic for when it matters otherwise can run software for when it doesn't. Here lies a HelloWorld Microblaze project to get quickly going for future projects later on. It is designed specifically for the Arty A7 board with Vivado 2018.3.
