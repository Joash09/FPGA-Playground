# FPGA-Playground
Repo with a collection of FPGA modules which I have implemented for fun

## ‚úî Completed

* Generic Fixed point PolynomialCalculator with Horner's Rule
* 8 bit ALU (added as git submodule)
* FIFO for crossing clock domains
* Basic Microblaze Project
* Random Number Generator with Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
* Fibonacci Sequence Generator
* Multiplexer

## ‚è∞ Work in Progress

* IEEE754 floating point arithmetic core

## üí° Wishlist
